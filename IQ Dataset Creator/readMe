This MATLAB code takes the MATLAB recordings and creates a dataset. 
This dataset is composed of several features:

    Name: is an integer value refering to which UAV the data belongs to

    Distance: is an integer value in feet refering to different distances at which the data was collected

    Burst: is an integer value refering to which burst the data belongs to. (out of 4)

    Fcenter: is a value refering to the center frequency of the data.

    Phase: is the offset radian angle. (97,000 points)

    Signal: is a set of 97,000 complex data points per recording

Now that we have our IQ dataset, we will transform our IQ data to a time based signal.

Please open folder IQ to RF Dataset.
