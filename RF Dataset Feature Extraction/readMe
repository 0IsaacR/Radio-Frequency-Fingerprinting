In this folder we take the RF waveforms and extract features from the signals.

REQUIREMENTS:   MATLAB Audio_System_Toolbox

Method 1
Extract 13 key features:
  Name: Integer value refering to which UAV is transmitting.
TIME BASED:
  Feature 1    Mean
  Feature 2    Peak Value
  Feature 3    Standard Deviation
  Feature 4    Shape Factor
  Feature 5    Signal to Noise Ratio
  Feature 6    Crest Factor
  Feature 7    Clearance Factor
  Feature 8    Impulse Factor
FREQUENCY BASED:
  Feature 9    Mean Frequency
  Feature 10   Median Frequency
  Feature 11   Band Power
  Feature 12   Occupied Bandwidth
  Feature 13   Power Bandwidth


Method 2 
Extract Linear Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients and engineer new features

In this method we use audio based techniques to extract 188 features.

After creating these two datasets you can use the built in apps on MATLAB such as the Classification Learner to run different machine learning models on these datasets.
