Thanks for visiting. For now the powerpoint presentation and a non published journal article is available. I will add the code and data once i finish cleaning it up.

The purpose of this project was to mildly investigate if we could reduce the amount of data needed to accurately train a machine learning model on RF data.
This study aims to look at if we can capture the soul of the signal with out needing 97,000 points per signal.
For now my results indicate that 188 points per signal does a pretty good job. Using these 188 points, what else can we find out about the signal?
